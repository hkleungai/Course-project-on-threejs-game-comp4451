Hello everyone. This is Group 18.

I am Jimmy, your main presenter on the game proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.

Here is a brief outline of the presentation.

We would walk you through some main items,

and finish off with a very quick demo on our current work.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.

Let's begin with a short introduction.

Our game is named Steel of Starling.

It is a turn-based, strategic board game.

Along the game journey,

players would be exposed to a top-down view of an abstract 2D game map,

and they would make careful and adaptive moves in order to destroy the enemy.

This game would then be handy for people

who are competitive and have a tactical mindset.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next we would talk about the motivations for the game.

The classical examples of strategic board game

are the Daisenyaku series and the Diplomacy,

which respectively brings the customizable game map idea,

and the simultaneoues turn-based feature alive.

Our goal is to incorporate these great features

along with some more of own extensions,

such as those on weapon's customization, and AI-player design, etc,

for making a fun and fair game.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now we talk about the Gameplay.

Due to the tight time limit of this course project,

the board game would be simplified to a human-versus-AI, competition-based game.

In other words, in each turn,

the possible negotiations between players would be less emphasized.

But still, we require players to make decision on a common timeframe,

and let any possible collisions happen afterwards,

so that the game could remain fun and unpredictable.

And as mentioned, apart from game unit deployment,

players would be guided to other actions that could supplement their main attack,

like researching for resources supply, and exploring game map geometry, etc.

As for the AI-player, its decision would be partly probabilistic and partly situational,

depending on the actual game development and the unit it enounters.

With such unpredictability and also countering between the game units,

players would be forced to make non-greedy stratigic move

so that no trivial dominance can be drawn in any cases.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For actual implementation, we would adopt threeJs and WebGL as the base framework,

so that we can make nicer graphic effect,

and for any possible struggles or extensions later,

we may refer to a modern web framework solution.

Of course there are challenges that we have to overcome.

One is the design of AI-player.

It has to be unpredictable and knows how to play a fair game at the same time.

Hence it would be crucial to construct and tune various metrics for the AI-player.

Another challenge is to make the map and the units sufficiently visually appealing.

And this touches the core of the mechansim of game grid arrangement and game unit design.

Luckily we have made a small step in this part.

To give you a more a contrete view on the game layout,

here we present a quick demo of a preliminary game map,

with game units represented by various patterns.

With the demo done, I think this is a good place to stop.

Thank you.
