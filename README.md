This is the repository for the game project in COMP4451. More Details to be added...

## Kickstart The Project

Below we briefly go over how one may start this project real quick.

- Install any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, ...) and the VSCode IDE and git.
- Clone this repositiory with git.
- Open VSCode and navigate to this project folder.
- Install the `live server` extension.
- Open the vscode command palette (by `ctrl + shift + p` or (`ctrl + p` and a `>` prefix)), and choose `Live Server: Open with Live Server`.
- Let your browser do the work :)
- Remember to shut down the live server from the command palette before you leave your work.

Alternatively you may use some http-server modules from python or NodeJs, by from my experience they are not that friendly or efficient so...
