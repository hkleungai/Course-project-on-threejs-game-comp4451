## Kickstart The Project

Below we briefly go over how one may start this project real quick.

- Install necessary softwares
  - Any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, ...)
  - VSCode, git
  - NPM, Yarn (Check the [official installation guide](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable))
- Clone this repositiory with git.
- Open IDE and navigate to this project folder.
- Open the terminal, by typing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> if necessary.
  - Issue `npm --version` and `yarn --version` for safe-check.
  - Issue `yarn` to install the necessary dependencies. ~~It may take a while for first-time installation.~~
  - Issue `yarn start` to start the application.
- Go to https://localhost:3000 to see for the results.
  - See [this](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv-flow) for how to set customized port number in your local.

**Remainder** -- For later development, always issue `yarn` before `yarn start` to make sure your local modules are up-to-date with the newest `package.json`. Or you can always do a one-liner `yarn && yarn start`.
