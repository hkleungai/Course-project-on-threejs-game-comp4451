1.

Hello everyone. This is Group 18. \\

I am Max, your main presenter on the final report of the COMP4451 project. \\

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. (At best replace this slide with live demo)

This game grid represent what we promised

at the beginning at the proposal stage,

and we finally made it. \\

Steel of Starling, is a simultaneous turn-based strategy game

In each round, players at the same planning phase,

issues commands involving game units movement, or training, etc,

in order to defeat their enemies. \\

Once this is done, the game application would execute players' moves,

and let all the collisions and effects take place. \\

For now, the game is going with single player, human-vs-computer mode. \\

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.

Hope you agree that this game looks amazing,

and indeed behind the scenes, we have put a lot of efforts in the game production. \\

As you may imagine, this game involves a frontend, a mini-backend,

along with careful programming and algorithmic calculation. \\

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.

In frontend, we have done quite a lot.

It starts with a simple menu in the start page. \\

Then it comes with a set of flexible floating bubbles

showing useful resources information to the users at any instant. \\

Also there is a collapsible menu with sub-options

that can show or hide upon users' cursor movement. \\

The action menu items are each injected with callbacks that help build up the game flow. \\

Then the challenge comes when we found that

there could be collisions of mouse behaviour on css and canvas element.

To deal with this, we switch some availble commands to the keyboard control

in order to create a better user experience. \\

It is unfortunate that we cannot make the keyboard instructions on time,

but we would certainly include all these key events in later report or documentations. \\

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.

In the backend part, we serve some custom gamemap to the program. \\

They includes information like

game unit statistics, amount of available resources at the game start, etc. \\

While we may not be able to show the map generation engine to you,

we do have some example setup of various maps and resources

in form of json file in the submitted codes. \\

But since we are using web,

a natural challenge is the heavy resources payload on browser.

Thus one possible extention here would be

having lazy loading and persumably more code splitting on server side.

Another extension could be making the map configuation available even at the frontend side,

so that game players can manipulate their own games via UI. \\

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.

Perhaps the most interesting and challenging part is in the algorithmic computation.

As mentioned previously, we require certain weights and bias

for the evaluation of A-star paths for the unit movement. \\

And even before that we have to come up with nice metric

for any meaningful calculation done on a hexegonal packing. \\

So you would certainly see function utils

for inspecting, or searching for neighbors or surrounding enemies for the game units. \\

And upon these computation, the machine player can determine

what moves he should make in his round for larger winning probability. \\

Then of course it comes with the difficulties in testing and performance evaluation,

and things like obtaining the best weights and bias are still not perfectly done,

and we simply left those to be future extensions. \\

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.

This soon comes to an end of our final report. \\

Although the project still has a lot of room for improvement,

but hope you all can enjoy it well. \\

Thank you.
